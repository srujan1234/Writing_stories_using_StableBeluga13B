# Writing_stories_using_StableBeluga13B


**Using Transformers library to generate inspirational short stories based on a dataset of quotes. The code utilizes the StableBeluga-13B model for text generation, providing both a high-level pipeline approach and a direct model loading method for more control.**



Installation of the Transformers library.

Initialization of a high-level text generation pipeline.

Loading the StableBeluga-13B model and tokenizer directly.

**Story Generation:**

Loading a dataset of quotes (e.g., cleaned_quotes.csv).

Defining a function to generate random short stories based on the provided quotes.

Generating and printing short stories for the first row of the dataset.

**Improved Story Generation with Transformers Model:**

Utilizing the StableBeluga-13B model for more sophisticated story generation.

Tokenizing the input quote, generating text, and decoding the output.

Creating and printing short stories that incorporate the generated text for the first row of the dataset.

Happy storytelling! **:)**
